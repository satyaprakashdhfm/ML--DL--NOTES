    "Handling class imbalance in image classification involves techniques to ensure that the model doesn't become biased toward the majority class. Here are common approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data-Level Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Oversampling the Minority Class**: Duplicate or augment images from the minority classes to increase their representation. Data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, cropping, flipping) can help create diverse samples for minority classes without introducing exact duplicates.\n",
    "   - **Undersampling the Majority Class**: Randomly reduce the number of samples in majority classes to match the minority class size. This is more feasible with larger datasets, though it risks losing important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Algorithm-Level Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Class Weights Adjustment**: Many deep learning frameworks allow specifying a weight for each class in the loss function. This penalizes misclassifications of the minority class more than the majority class, encouraging the model to pay more attention to the minority class.\n",
    "   - **Focal Loss**: Focal loss is designed for class imbalance by dynamically scaling the loss for hard-to-classify examples, typically from minority classes. It modifies the cross-entropy loss by adding a scaling factor that reduces the loss for well-classified examples and focuses on hard examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ \n",
    "   \\text{Focal Loss} = -\\alpha (1 - p_t)^\\gamma \\log(p_t)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where \\( p_t \\) is the predicted probability for the true class, \\( \\alpha \\) is a balancing factor for class imbalance, and \\( \\gamma \\) controls the focus on hard examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Hybrid and Advanced Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Two-Stage Training**: Train the model first on the original data, then fine-tune with balanced classes or using only the minority class. This approach helps retain information while enhancing sensitivity to minority classes.\n",
    "   - **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use techniques like **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate synthetic images for the minority class. GANs can create realistic, diverse images that augment the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Self-Supervised Learning**: In self-supervised learning, the model learns from unlabeled data, which can later be fine-tuned on a smaller, balanced labeled dataset, improving minority class recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Evaluation Adjustments**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Metrics Beyond Accuracy**: Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC) to get a more balanced view of performance on imbalanced data, as accuracy can be misleading with class imbalance.\n",
    "   - **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Reviewing the confusion matrix helps identify if the model is biased toward majority classes, guiding further balancing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each technique can be combined depending on the severity of imbalance, dataset size, and model complexity, but balancing data effectively often requires experimenting with several methods."
