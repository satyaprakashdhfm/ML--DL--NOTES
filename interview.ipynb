    "\n",
    "The **bank Customer churn Prediction** project was aimed at predicting whether bank customers would stay or leave, using a dataset containing 1,75,028 records and 34 features. The objective was to identify the factors influencing customer retention and predicting the customer will stay or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **data preprocessing** stage, unnecessary columns were removed, categorical features were encoded, and new features were engineered. Numeric data was also scaled to enhance model accuracy. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** revealed key insights: Credit Score, Age, and Tenure were found to be inversely related to customer departure, while the number of products held by a customer was directly proportional. Visual tools like heat maps, box plots, and KNN clustering were used to identify patterns and distinct customer segments.\n",
    "Additionally, permutation-based feature importance was employed with a Random Forest model, which provided a more accurate assessment of critical features like Balance, Age, and NumOfProducts. This analysis helped prioritize the factors that had the most significant impact on predicting whether a customer would leave or stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the **model building** phase, various classification models were tested, with XGBoost emerging as the top performer. ROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic. It is a graphical plot used to assess the performance of a binary classification model by plotting the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) at various threshold settings. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) provides an aggregate measure of model performance across all classification thresholds.\n",
    "The ROC curve helps evaluate a model's ability to distinguish between classes by plotting the True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate at various thresholds. A higher AUC indicates better model performance, with values closer to 1 showing greater effectiveness in correctly identifying positive cases.Ensemble models were also found to be more effective than individual models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The results and recommendations** from the project suggested that to improve customer retention, the bank should focus on key variables like seniority, credit score, gender, and no:of products. Based on prediction of customer churn….we can incentive the person to stay.\n",

    "# MMX:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preparation and Exploration:\n",
    "You began the project by importing essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, loading and cleaning the dataset. You ensured consistent column names and handled irrelevant rows. To better understand the data, you explored both numeric and categorical columns—analyzing value counts for categorical features and visualizing numeric data with histograms and scatter plots. These explorations gave insights into potential relationships between features and the target variable, \"sales.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering:\n",
    "With the insights from data exploration, you handled multicollinearity by creating adstock-adjusted versions of marketing spend variables, reflecting the diminishing impact of advertising over time. You also enhanced the temporal granularity by splitting the calendar_week feature into day, week, month, and year components. Categorical features were one-hot encoded, preparing the dataset for modeling, while ensuring important trends and patterns were captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Development, Evaluation, and Deployment:\n",
    "Starting with a baseline linear regression model, you achieved an initial R-squared score of 0.900 through cross-validation. To enhance performance, you used the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to remove highly correlated features. The final model was trained on selected features, resulting in an R-squared score of 0.872 on test data. Finally, you saved the model and created a predict_sales() function for easy deployment, allowing stakeholders to make predictions seamlessly by inputting new data for preprocessing and forecast generation.\n",

    "    Django sends confirmation (Server)\n",
    "    Browser updates display (Client)\n",
    "\n",
    "I developed an expense tracker application using Django, aimed at helping users track their daily expenses, categorize them, and visualize spending patterns over time. The application allows users to securely register and log in, manage expenses by adding, editing, and deleting them, and categorize spending by types such as food, transportation, etc. A dashboard provides visual insights into their spending trends through charts, and users can search and filter expenses by date or category.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the project’s backend, I used Django to handle server-side logic, including database models, views, and routing, while the frontend was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The database was set up using SQLite (or PostgreSQL), and I implemented Django’s authentication system for secure user login. I also used a data visualization library to generate spending charts, allowing users to gain insights into their financial habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the development process, I designed the user interface wireframes, created models for users, expenses, and categories, and implemented the views and templates to handle business logic. I also built forms for input validation and tested the project thoroughly. A key challenge was implementing proper access control to ensure users could only access their own data, which I solved using Django's permission system. The project was successful, and I plan to enhance it with features like budget planning and real-time data integration in the future.\n",

    "• Describe a time when you had to learn something new quickly ? Or challenge ? (ask them professional or personal)\n",
    "If professional:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, my focus was on AI and analytics due to my specialization, but I realized that as a computer science student, I also needed to acquire skills in web development to enhance my career prospects, especially with placements approaching. Recognizing the urgency, I quickly researched effective learning strategies and immersed myself in web development. I rapidly acquired the necessary skills and applied them by working on a project called 'Expense Tracker,' where I used Django, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. This experience not only broadened my skill set but also demonstrated my ability to adapt and learn new technologies swiftly.\n",
